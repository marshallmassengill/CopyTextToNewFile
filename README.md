Simple script I wrote to copy the contents of a text file (script) from original to a duplicate.

If you think this is dumb then you are right but you've also likely never encountered group policy which prevents you from running remote scripts.  Typically you can run some commands to disable the policy but not when you are on a domain and don't want to annoy the local security folks.

Thus, this script exists.  I've also enabled a right click context menu for explorer with it via a registry hack.

Enjoy.
